# M4A To MP3

A very crude audio converter that "just works". 

Usage: Click "Choose file(s)", select the M4As you want to convert, navigate to the file(s) you want converted, and select open. You can multi-select files to convert as well. Navigate to the location you want the converted files to go. 

Known issues: Not selecting a file after clicking on the "Choose file(s) and selecting cancel makes it act weird. So don't do it.
